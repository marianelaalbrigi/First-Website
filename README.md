This project is a learning exercise where I'm practicing and improving my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **SASS**. The goal is to create a simple website to learn how to work with these essential web technologies.

In this project, I created a basic webpage as part of my learning process. I used:

- **HTML** for the content structure.
- **CSS** for the basic styling.
- **SASS** to improve and organize styles in a modular way.
